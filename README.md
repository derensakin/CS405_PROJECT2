CS 405 Project 2: Texture + Illumination

Nur Deren Sakin

Description: 
This project focuses on enhancing 3D rendering by implementing various lighting techniques and texture mapping on 3D meshes. The project provides a platform to upload 3D model mesh and texture data, and render them in a web browser. The goal is to complete a series of tasks to improve the scene's lighting and texture handling capabilities.

Tasks:

Task 1 (Texture Handling): Modified setTexture to support textures of any size (not just power of two).

Task 2 (Lighting): Implemented ambient and diffuse lighting with a slider for ambient light density.

Task 3 (Specular Lighting): Added specular lighting using the Phong model, with an adjustable specular intensity slider.

Features:
* Multiple texture support for any image size.
* Basic lighting with adjustable ambient light intensity.
* Specular lighting for reflective surface effects.


Files: 
* project2.js: Main logic for texture handling and lighting.
* project2.html: HTML file for the 3D viewer.
* obj.js: 3D object model parser.

Usage:

To test and run the project:
Open project2.html in your browser.
Upload a 3D model mesh and texture of your choice.
Use the provided sliders to adjust lighting and texture settings.
