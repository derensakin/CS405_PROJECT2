CS 405 Project 2: Texture + Illumination

Nur Deren Sakin

Description: This project enhances 3D rendering by implementing texture mapping and lighting techniques on 3D meshes. It allows users to upload 3D model meshes and textures for rendering.

Tasks:
Task 1 (Texture Handling): Modified setTexture to support textures of any size (not just power of two).
Task 2 (Lighting): Implemented ambient and diffuse lighting with a slider for ambient light density.
Task 3 (Specular Lighting): Added specular lighting using the Phong model, with an adjustable specular intensity slider.

Features:
* Multiple texture support for any image size.
* Basic lighting with adjustable ambient light intensity.
* Specular lighting for reflective surface effects.

Usage: Open project2.html in your browser.
Upload a 3D model and texture.
Adjust lighting and texture settings using the provided sliders.

Files: 
* project2.js: Main logic for texture handling and lighting.
* project2.html: HTML file for the 3D viewer.
* obj.js: 3D object model parser.
